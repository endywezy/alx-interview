0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Project Overview

In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills and understanding of bitwise operations to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. This is crucial in ensuring data integrity and proper character representation in software systems.

Concepts and Skills Needed
To successfully complete this project, you will need to be familiar with the following concepts:

1. Bitwise Operations in Python
Mastery of bitwise operations such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and bit shifts (<<, >>).
Resource: Python Bitwise Operators

2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
Understanding the rules of UTF-8 encoding, including how characters are encoded across one or more bytes.
Recognizing valid UTF-8 patterns and how to decode them.
Resources:
UTF-8 Wikipedia
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle

3. Data Representation
Working with data at the byte level and manipulating the least significant bits (LSB) of integers.
Resource: Explore data handling techniques through Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and libraries.

4. List Manipulation in Python
Proficiency in iterating through lists, accessing elements, and using list comprehensions to streamline your code.
Resource: Python Lists

5. Boolean Logic
Applying logical operations to make decisions within your program, critical for determining the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.

Requirements
Development Environment:
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python 3.4.3

Code Style:
Follow PEP 8 guidelines (version 1.7.x).

File Structure:
All files should end with a new line.
The first line of all Python files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
Ensure that all files are executable.

Additional Resources

Mock Technical Interview: Practice your understanding of the concepts with a mock technical interview to solidify your knowledge.

This README provides a structured overview of the key concepts and resources necessary to succeed in the UTF-8 Validation project, along with specific requirements to follow during development.
