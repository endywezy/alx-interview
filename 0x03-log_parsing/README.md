Log Parsing Project
Overview
This project focuses on parsing and processing log data streams in real-time using Python. The goal is to read from standard input (stdin), handle data in a specific format, and perform calculations based on the input data.

Concepts Covered
File I/O in Python: Reading from sys.stdin line by line.
Signal Handling: Managing keyboard interruptions (CTRL + C).
Data Processing: Parsing strings, aggregating data, and computing summaries.
Regular Expressions: Validating the format of each line.
Dictionaries: Counting occurrences of status codes and accumulating file sizes.
Exception Handling: Handling possible exceptions during file reading and data processing.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Run the script:
./log_parser.py < log_file.txt

Usage
Reading from stdin:
Python

import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Process each line
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Handling keyboard interruption:
Python

import signal
import sys

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
    sys.exit(0)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Parsing and processing data:
Python

import re

log_pattern = re.compile(r'...')
for line in sys.stdin:
    match = log_pattern.match(line)
    if match:
        # Extract data and process
